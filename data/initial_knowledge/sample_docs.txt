Agent Lab - Learning Platform Documentation

This is a sample document for the RAG knowledge base.

What is Agent Lab?
Agent Lab is a learning platform designed for experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs),
Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

Key Features:
1. LLM Integration via LangChain
2. MCP Server/Client Management
3. RAG System with Vector Embeddings
4. FastAPI Backend
5. Interactive Frontend

Architecture:
- Backend: Python with FastAPI
- Database: MySQL for persistence
- Frontend: React/Vue (to be implemented)
- LLM Framework: LangChain
- MCP: Anthropic's Model Context Protocol

Use Cases:
- Learn about prompt engineering
- Experiment with different LLM models
- Build RAG applications
- Understand MPC protocol
- Test chat interfaces
