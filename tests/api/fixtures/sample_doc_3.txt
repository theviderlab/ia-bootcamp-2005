SOLID Principles in Software Engineering

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change. Each class should have a single responsibility or job.

Example: Instead of a User class handling authentication, database operations, and email notifications, split these into separate classes.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Example: Use abstract base classes or protocols to allow new implementations without changing existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application.

Example: A Square class inheriting from Rectangle should behave correctly when used as a Rectangle.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

Example: Instead of one large FileOperations interface, create smaller interfaces like Readable, Writable, Deletable.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Example: A service class should depend on an abstract repository interface, not a concrete database implementation.
